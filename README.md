# Handy-Flappy-Bird-with-FPGA

The interactive flappy bird game was designed as my 1st-year EIE team project and took 6 weeks to finish. The project is mainly about overlay design on a PYNQ board. Our design takes a real-time video processing stream as input, performs pixel-wise implementation to detect the hand's position, and outputs the bird's position to the game user interface.
